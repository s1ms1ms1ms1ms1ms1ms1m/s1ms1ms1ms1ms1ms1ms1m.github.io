<p>hello</p>
<p>this is the first post on this blog, april 4 2024. ive just destroyed some pour soul&rsquo;s hugo css to make this</p>
<p>the point of this site is to post takes/thoughts. there are some philosophical reasons to having your own blog and expressing your views online. i think it would be cool if unknown strangers found this mysterious webpage and agreed with some of the future posts</p>
<p>the goal is to go as MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE. just PURE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS, posting INTERESTING STUFF.</p>
<p>thank you, gentlemen</p>
