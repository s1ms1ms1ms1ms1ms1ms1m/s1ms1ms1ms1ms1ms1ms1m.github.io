<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In this blog post, I argue that in Western culture, there has been a distinct cultural shift from idealist to materlialist thinking, and generally, the lack of understanding of past texts and inner reasoning by modern people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idealism&rdquo; is literally correct and materialist thinking leads to an autistic ignoration of the inner self.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not a philosopher. I am very interested in learning more about this topic, and especially relations to theology. If you completely disagree, or if I am saying something stupid, please argue with me (email me brah).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I am deeply inspired by the structure of The Enneads by Plotinus and Summa Theologiae by Aquinas. And maybe another manifesto that enumerates its sections <strong>:o)</strong></p>
<h3 id="what-is-materialism">What is materialism</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modern people turn to scientific explanations for all events. If an event can be perceived scientifically, that is, if it fits within the material worldview, then it is valid. Note that the scientific method is fundamentally an <strong>empiricist</strong> perspective of attaining knowledge: knowledge can ultimately only be derived after experimental confirmation. In addition, and since people are composed of material components, this has lead to the perspective that cognition too can be understood solely through a material worldview. In particular, actions and perceptions are held to be manifestations/outcome of a material process, and can be understood as such. The materialist therefore jumps to the following point: <em>understanding of the human condition can be attained through an exclusively material understanding of the world</em>. That is, by totally explaining/understanding every physical process within a person, we understand their cognition. This general viewpoint, and many perspectives associated with it, I will define to be <strong>materialism</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Idealism</strong> generally says that reality can only be known through &ldquo;ideas and mental structures&rdquo;. The material world is reflected with mental <em>categories</em> and <em>representations</em> in the mind. To understand the structure of the world, we must understand the interactions between mental (ideal) categories that represent these objects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="religion-in-modern-culture">Religion in modern culture</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>There is a disrespect or ignoration of religion in the modern, Western, culture. While there exist &ldquo;spiritually inclined&rdquo; types who are spiritual and use Eastern symbolism (with little regard for its broader cultural significance), there is no real structured religious understanding or thinking in our culture, as it relates to daily life <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. One point that this vacuum is attributed to are the historical actions of the church, which is justified, since the actions of the church as an institution have historically not represented the beliefs of Christians <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. People view religion as an instrument of the institution, and refuse to be &ldquo;subject to an agenda&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> that the institution wants you to believe. In particular, Christian symbolism is suggested to be a &ldquo;construct&rdquo; that is intended as a means for &ldquo;controlling&rdquo; thought/cognition. The point that I severely disagree is that of scientific progress superceding the need for religious thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science and religion are fundamentally different <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, yet they are not dialectically opposed, like suggested by some. That is, one can believe in scientific expalantions without needing to refute religion. Science is focused on that which is material, ie. things in the physical world, objects that experiments can be done on. Whatever your exact definition of science <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, my main point is that it is fundamentally empiricist, and focused on observations of material processess. What exactly is religion?</p>
</li>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Religious texts are strange to the modern person. If a moderner were to sit down and try to read a religous text for the first time, they would find the language esoteric, and the cultural references as strange. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3s47-p9rE0">Luke Smith argues</a> that the &ldquo;mindset&rdquo; of religious text is fundamentally different from the modern use of language. There are aspects of modern life where different language is required; day-to-day conversations, technical conversations, metaphorical speech. The way in which I describe how to make a cup of coffee differs from technical descriptions of things to do at work. Technical descriptions may use more Latin-derived words that have specific connotations, whereas daily speech is less specific, and using a technical term would sound very strange/robotic. The connotations of particular words totally influence the thing that we are trying to describe (see <a href="https://msburkeenglish.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/uncleftish-beholding-aka-atomic-theory.pdf">uncleftish beholdings</a> (atomic theory), a text about atomic theory written with Latin-derived replaced using Germanic words in English). The point is that in English, the distinction between day-to-day things, metaphor, and more abstract/technical language exists. In ancient times, this distinction did not exist, and the mindset of reasoning was likely very different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of asking &ldquo;Did the Greeks believe in their gods?&rdquo; we should ask &ldquo;what were the Greeks referencing with their gods?&rdquo;. Material objects have essences, mental representations of their characteristics that transcend the object itself. For example, apples are red. The category of &ldquo;redness&rdquo; is a mental object that is not bound to the particular physical apple. Each thing is a combination of perfected (I will call) categories; abstracted essences of objects that your mind operates with <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Many things are this way, and there are many driving forces in the material world that you drive your life. There may be rain tomorrow, or it may storm for a week, or it may be beautiful and sunny; either one of these would create a change. The ocean can provide food and transport, or it can be tormenting and punishing. Each depends on something beyond your control and is a fundamental force in the life of an ancient person. The forces themselves have a particular essence, and if an essence is personified, we arrive at a <strong>god</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Greek gods were personifications of essences that drove daily life <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The interactions between Greek gods therefore describe an interaction between fundamental forces of life. When the Greeks told their myths, they were describing complicated processes that occur in the world, personified as interactions between gods. In their view, they were giving a &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; description of the world, since they were explaining the physical: it was a projection of the mental onto the material. The distinction I just described likely needed to be made very recently. In antiquity, the objects and the essence of the object were essentially viewed as the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this perspective, Plato&rsquo;s forms and Ideals make much sense. To understand the objects existing in the world, and since the physical object and its higher essence are identified, early idealists believed that the nature of a physical object can <strong>entirely</strong> be understood through its ideal representations, with little further empirical tests required (relevant image below). This does not make much sense for physical categories, as the material is something dealt with empirically. However, the categories of Gods do not restrict to material objects; the Gods included personifications of cognitive states, and myths gave a symbolic representation of how they interact. Moral information could be structured in this way. To summarize, the Greeks set up mental <em>categories</em> for objects, personified them, then structured their interaction through myth, developing a densely symbolic cultural understanding that could be passed on.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

<ol start="9">
<li>How then, do we arrive at monotheism? What is Christianity and how do we understand God? In polytheistic religions, there are often rankings of the gods based on their importance. In many cases, there is the idea of a &ldquo;creator God&rdquo; which creates all other deities (ie. the distinction between Yahweh (material creator) and the creator God by the Gnostics). This corresponds to a type of hierarchy of concepts, that are linked to one an other in a hierarchical manner, each gaining a more abstract representation (like inheritance in object oriented programming but for mental categories). The notion of a &ldquo;creator God&rdquo; corresponds to an emanating being from which every possible mental category is created. It is the &ldquo;the circle with infinite circumference and center nowhere&rdquo;, the &ldquo;perfected&rdquo; thing, the principle from which all other principles come from. God is a representation of the order driving interactions between all other categories <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. How does this relate to Christianity?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>John 1:1</em>: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>John 1:14</em>: The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="10">
<li>It is extremely important to note that Word (logos/λόγος, where &ldquo;logic&rdquo; comes from) was viewed as a principle of giving order, knowledge, and used to refer to sentences/propositions. Particularly, the use in Greek refers to operation of mental categories, that is reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-is-christianity-about">What is Christianity about</h3>
<ol start="11">
<li>We can therefore understand the actions and teaching of Christ to represent actions that are in tune with the underlying nature of reality; Christ is a projection of the perfected ideal onto the material. We can simply understand the Christian story as a representation of life that is in alignment with logos, and the greater perfected order of the world. This is abstract, takes some <em>faith</em>, and generally deals with <em>principles</em> rather than empirical knowledge. In response to Paragraph 3, we can understand the misconception that Christianity is about controlling thought; Indeed, the mental structures and categories that Christianity establishes are entirely constructed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="reconciling-with-scientific-empiricism">Reconciling with scientific empiricism</h3>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<p>Knowledge of ideal principles and actions cannot be derived through empiricism, and if it can, you have only one life to live. The principles identified by Christianity are mental constructs and categories that guide people to live in harmony with the chaotic and unknown world. The categories and constructs offered by Christianity (in its original form)  are not ones of control, but attempt to teach people to know the self. This major gap is lacking in scientific empiricism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of the material composition of an object does not directly suggest knowledge of its properties, especially if there is some emergent behaviour. Our mind is chemical is driven by an extremely complicated interaction of biochemical processes. It is simply not possible to derive what it means to see &ldquo;red&rdquo; from the correct combination of neurotransmitter firing frequencies among billions of neurons. There exists a worm (C. Elegans) with ~1000 cells, ~300 of which are the nervous system, and neuroscientists cannot map the cell function to simple living state of the worm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental structure and principled action cannot be categorized entirely within the scientific setting and there is an objective need for understanding the world in a moral way. If we are to take good actions, there must be a hierarchy of actions, and actions must be compared against some fundamental principles. Underlying principles are the object of religion, and require symbolic representation of the world, which is the realm of idealism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scientific empricism and idealism (particularly in religion) are not necessarily opposed; they address fundamentally different aspects of the world. While many modern people simply suggest that science offers &ldquo;answers&rdquo;, structured symbolic thinking (possibly in the form of religious thinking) is extremely necessary on a personal level, yet is ignored as superceded by science. There is no true tension between religion and scientific explanations for the world, other than being dialectically opposed when viewed as an ideology that you need to identify with.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I will cut this short since this blog post has been too long in the making. Jung is right - we have in born unconscious representations of the world, and as we civilize, we forget their effect on our reasoning. Modern people live in <em>dunya</em> without truly realizing the symbols and structure that religions in the past have operated with.</p>

<p>When you close your eyes, you may quickly realize that you are in a cathedral.</p>

<p>Please debate me about this post! I am currently reading Plotinus and some of Carl Jung&rsquo;s basic writings. I believe in a form of Christian neo-idealism because it is correct. I have a feeling the theme of &ldquo;idealism vs materialism&rdquo; will be a trend on this blog, since it seems this is the fundamental problem in Western philosophy</p>
<p>I want a hot girl to email me telling me to read Hegel</p>

<p>Humans in the natural world definitely do this, with similar themes among myths, probably evidence an inborn capacity for information compression using symbolic reasoning.
