<p>My friend commented that `this is the second-best type of internet presence, after having none&rsquo; after I showed this blog. I fully agree, and in this post, I want to talk about the state of the internet and possible motivations for making an anonymous internet blog. Maybe you will be inspired to do the same, and we can RETVRN to a low-entropy 90s internet, or at least understand its value.</p>
<h2 id="wonderful-websites">Wonderful websites</h2>

<h2 id="state-of-the-internet">State of the internet</h2>
<p>Horrid. I have a few things that annoy me about the internet as it is now. It has strayed from its (in my opinion) purpose. Information is increasingly difficult to find, presentation of ideas is limited by formatting, and algorithms reinforce patterns of behaviour.</p>
<p>I should say something about how I view the World Wide Web. To me, the point of the internet is that any piece of information is freely available. We have the most advanced technology to share information that humanity, and possibly conscious life, ever has had. We have an infinite store of human experience, thoughts, and archives of past knowledge. At a personal level, we can instantly communicate to any resolution, including with images, video, audio, text, and permanently save our work and thoughts. This technology may rival the invention of writing and of libraries, since information can be stored for indefinite amounts of time. It is truly amazing when you think about it. Every person who can read can have total access to all information compiled by humanity. No gatekeeping.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the case. Information is increasingly hard to find. I do not want to talk about big tech and algorithms/bias because that discussion is tedious at this point. You have probably tried to find basic information, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvDyQUpaFf4">finding a recipe</a>, and been totally disappointed. Websites do not care about archiving and spreading information anymore, with exceptions <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A shame.</p>
<p>The internet is not about information at this point. The (personal) reason that most people use the internet now is for social media. Their interactions online are mediated by social media platforms that reward particular types of behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-cultural-history-of-the-internet">A brief cultural history of the internet</h2>
<p>Here is a zoomer&rsquo;s view of the evolution of the internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>90s</strong>:  Web 1.0. The peak. The average guy could write a webpage and put it up. This was like the Cambrian explosion of the purpose of the internet; it moved away from the university to the personal. You browse strange pages online (alone in your room), and see what your fellow man was thinking in an authentic way. It was a time of genuine self expression online, unconstrained to formats. Naive and unironic `work in progress&rsquo; construction man gifs on webpages. There were no social standard for what a website should look like. People envisioned how they wanted their thoughts to be interpreted, and the formatting followed. This was truly a silly, carefree, jovial, frontier-like time for the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>00s</strong>: A popularization of the internet. The first social media sites including MySpace and Facebook emerged. While webpages outside these social networks were still popular, it became normal to use social networks. The most interesting part of this time was the creation of forums like bodybuilding.com and other anonymous forums :0). People still interacted with each other in an unfiltered, unironic way. Sites served a purpose based in reality, where users would meet to discuss so far as they relate to their life. The internet was really a &lsquo;side thing&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that people used sometimes, maybe like a phone or something. People who used the internet too much were seen as weirdos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>10s</strong>: Interaction with others is primarily through using social networks. Forums became centralized, and less immediately related to reality. The average internet user was on Reddit, Instagram, etc. and it became normal (at least there was a large group of people who did) to spend a lot of time on these websites. The explicit thing that happened: people viewed the internet as a parallel reality. A lot of socialization happened online, and there was a schism in how you were perceived in person vs. how you were perceived online. For example, instagram had a rigid format for how you could post your photos and how others viewed your posts. Since it was very popular, it kind of `mattered&rsquo; (at least if you were a young person), and people created &lsquo;feeds&rsquo; to give the correct impression. Of course, people are not parallelizable, and in-person interaction became influenced by maintaining such impressions. On other sites, like Reddit, you had the homogenization of beliefs to be neither-here-nor-there, generic, &ldquo;thats not good man&rdquo;, &ldquo;am i the asshole?&rdquo;, interactions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This was all moderated by losers who wanted to &lsquo;do the right thing&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. The meme of the discord admin.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>20s</strong>: This started with covid, during which a LOT of people stayed inside and used their phone 24/7. Especially teenagers. As a gen-z boomer myself, I see kids that were in high school during this time, and I understand that they were influenced by tiktok. They basically act like the band-kids from your school but in tiktok slogans. The format of tiktok is built to capture your attention and to trap your dopamine system. To maintain others&rsquo; interactions, people needed to give a silly/quirky/awesome impression in 10 seconds. Needless to say, this had a major impact on their appearance in-person, their political opinions, etc. On places like reddit, people became deeply invested in their soy-chambers, echoing the same stupid points. Even the average non-internet user had to have mainly online interactions for a long period of time. I&rsquo;m just trying to say that the internet truly became a parallel reality. If someone lives in their internet-reality, it is extremely clear, since their in-person behaviour is distinct.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is increasingly difficult to find genuine self expression on the internet. Not in a &ldquo;be yourself man&rdquo; kind of way. The way information is presented is highly formatted and filtered. Instead of owning webpages and posting whatever you want, you have feeds, pages, etc. These are decided by social media platforms that decide how you express your online presence. Your interactions are mediated by something outside your direct control, and rewarded by algorithms that are designed to capture your attention. Other problems include privacy, tracking, you wasting your time, getting stupid content, seeing too many ads, not really using the internet for information.</p>
<p>Additionally, the internet is just filled with junk everywhere. A lot of text is probably going to be generated by LLMs. We already have chinese factories selling chemicals with deepfakes of famous american podcasters. I think this is just the trend for the rest of the internet; mountains of AI-generated garbage with no benefit to the people that watch them, all conveniently posted in your instagram reels/twitter bot replies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m avoiding talking about the influence on modern politics because it&rsquo;s been said before.</p>
<p>To summarize, there are three main problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information availability</strong>. It is hard to find information, due to auto-generated garbage and algorithms, making the internet stray from its point.</li>
<li><strong>Centralization</strong>. Internet usage is centralized to a few main sites that serve as a parallel to in-person reality.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural influence.</strong> Since so many people use these parallel websites, their in-person views and expression is directly influenced by their main social media.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>Truly, the internet should be the most advanced tool for sharing information and growth through learning. It is interesting to be able to record your thoughts, put them online, and have others read them to agree/disagree. Once upon a time, intelligent people wrote long letters to each other, carefully thinking about their thoughts and opinions, engaging in productive reasoning. This is truly the way forward; we will only continue towards a GPT-driven dead internet theory-tier dark age if things continue as they do.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our expression online should be determined by us and our `content consumption&rsquo; should be more in our control. To bring true value to the internet, we need more long form human-written webpages about the things that interest us, and to contribute to projects/sites that bring value to us. Through this blog, I want to write unfiltered posts that maybe my friends will read in long form and agree with. Somewhere online, this blog post exists, and anyone can make their own conclusions from it. This is what the internet should be about, and this is what I want to participate in. A typewriter-like internet presence.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is a good example. Many sites that I find most useful are not bloatified and do not want to cave to this trend.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>In the 2010s, I visited family in a `developing nation&rsquo;. Tech trends and influences from the west always lagged a few years, and I could definitely feel the transition in technology there vs. living in the west. There was a point in time where the difference was extremely clear and given in terms of phones. Already in the west, it was normal to use iphones and social media everywhere. There, this was a flex, and people used computers 00s style, browsing forums/emails at home and generally and using flip phones/button phones. I also had the sense that people didn&rsquo;t think the internet was distinct from reality.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I think there is an interesting point to be made about how &ldquo;the culture of webpages&rdquo; was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjbyDU0WzYI">informed by the mechanism for which posts are promoted</a>. The culture of a webpage isnt real by the way. People just over-socialized and identified with things that are external to them. its like ideology but for dog videos or mechanical pencil brands.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
